a backup script that creates a backup of a source directory and copies that over to a destination directory.
It checks whether or not a file exists, it backs it up incrementally
if it already exists, it check if its the newest and will not copy
if it doesn't exits, it will create it
it will always check files added, it will check if the files in the source exist in the destination directory


[We wanted to go back to the drawing board and first actually build a file backup system, not with rsync, that's a tentative change
that we're gonna figure out and not on a cron job, it's just a draft incremental build]


#!/bin/bash

source=/home/micha/Project1/source        (My variables to read and copy files to and from)
dest=/home/micha/Project1/destination

for file in $(find $source -printf "%P\n") ; do
if [ -a $dest/$file ] ; then			   (For loop - checks the files, tells it to look in the source and print format)
								(If statement: (-a checks if destination file exists) this is looping all the 
								files in the source and listing everything in a recursive manner. meaning all the 
								files underneath source are in a relative path, so it basically checks anything 
behind source and if it exists behind destination. So it checks if the copied files have already been created. Then if its there, 
it doesn't need to be copied)
   

				
        if [ $source/$file -nt $dest/$file ] ; then  		(if the source file is newer than the destination)
        echo "Copying: newer file"				(it will leave a message)
        cp -r $source/$file $dest/$file	(it copies recursivley, so that it also copies all of the underlying folders and stuff)
        else							(if thats not the case)
        echo "File $file already exists"			(report that it would be redundant, and basically skip copying it)
        fi 								(end it with fi)
    else 								(if that's not the case then)
    echo "$file is being copied into $dest"		(report the file being copied)
    cp -r $source/$file $dest/$file		
    fi								(end with fi)
done									(done)
